Inspired by the We Rate Dogs twitter account (https://twitter.com/dog_rates).


Full front-end website built around the Dog-API. The site presents one random dog picture to the user, one at a time, and allows the user to optionally select a breed for the random pictures. For each dog picture, the user is allowed to assign a numeric rating to the dog between 10-16. When the user assigns a numeric rating, the rating and dog picture are stored in local storage. Finally, there is a dashboard page that allows the user to see all of the dogs that they have rated.
